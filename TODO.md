# Remaining Issues

- Home page header is too cramped together. Can I expand it so the title has breathing room? 
- I should define a Hugo `_partial` to automatically load `avif` vs `jpg` vs `png` depending
  on browser support. I did this manually in home page rn. 
  Hugo even has automatic image conversion, so I won't need to manually upload these kinds
  of commands again...
- I should fix the "Projects" button. I should redirect to the home page, where I'll have a 
  list of all of my ongoing projects. There, I'll describe Mage.
