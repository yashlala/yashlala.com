why you have spurious &ldquo;merged branch X into X&rdquo; commits after a git pull, this
presentation is for you.
Git&rsquo;s CLI UI is phenomenally unintuitive (eg: git tag vs git remote -v vs
git branch -a). Git&rsquo;s default configuration is almost as bad.
Don&rsquo;t worry!
This presentation tries to build intuitions in a way that separates the
beautiful idea from the inconsistent implementation.
Once we see behind the smoke and mirrors, we&rsquo;ll be able to set up git aliases
that make more sense to us. You&rsquo;ll never have to remember the difference
between --staged and --cached again."
