  content="My first non-technical and non-historical topic! Today is meant as a change of
pace before we go on hiatus for the quarter; it&rsquo;s information-light and full of
pretty pictures of ocean life.
In this presentation, I talk about:

Oceanbed life in the past.

Why the Miller-Urey experiment is oversimplified.
Three requirements for recurring lifelike chemical reactions, and why
undersea vents uniquely provide all three.


Oceanbed life today.

A runthrough of the ecosystem.
Why deep sea life is large and scary: Kleiber&rsquo;s rule, Bergman&rsquo;s rule, etc.


Future oceanbed life

How stable are these ecosystems under global-warming related changes?
The impact of undersea mining.
