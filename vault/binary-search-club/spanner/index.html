Spanner
system is implemented &ndash; and how it&rsquo;s performance seemingly defies the
CAP theorem.
I&rsquo;ve tried to keep this presentation accessible to people without a deep
systems background, but do let me know if you weren&rsquo;t at my
prior presentation about distributed
systems. I promise I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on you throughout today&rsquo;s presentation.
In this presentation, I:

Introduce the CAP theorem using a hypothetical groupchat as an example.
Discuss strict and loose consistency models.
Explain how Spanner provides consistency without angering the CAP theorem.

Explain the underlying theory (clock drift error bounds => &ldquo;wait out the
uncertainty&rdquo;)
Talk about the expensive hardware that makes this feasible (atomic clocks
everywhere!).


Conclusion: with enough money and hardware, you can create large-scale,
strongly-consistent, systems &ndash; even when the theoreticians say otherwise.
