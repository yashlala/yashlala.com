window? In this presentation, I walk through the history of UNIX terminals.
I discuss:

Antique methods of electrical communication, from Morse code to the famous
barbed wire telephone network
used by American farmers.
A historical example of the difficulties of synchronous communication
protocols.
The use of punch cards as both a means of I/O logging (stock tickers) and
as a means of programming (Jaquard looms => IBM 1401).
The historical basis for a separate kernel TTY layer, and the ugly
consequences.
Finally: how communication asynchrony, punch cards, and the TTY system
architecture cause the problems we know and love today.
