My name is Yash Lala. I'm a fourth-year CS undergraduate student at UCLA.
My interests include parallel computation, distributed system design,
and climbing.

This page is under construction in much the same way that a stalagmite is under
construction. Don't expect to see quick changes around here ;)

If you have feedback or just want to chat, feel free to contact me via the
links at the bottom of the page!
