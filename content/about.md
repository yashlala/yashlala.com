My name is Yash Lala. 
I am a now third-year CS undergraduate student at UCLA.
My interests include parallel computation, distributed system design,
and climbing. 

My resume can be accessed via my GitHub, or via this 
[link](https://github.com/yashlala/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).

As of 2020-12-02, this page is still under construction. 
I've just migrated from my first "manual" website attempt to a hugo-based
setup. This templated version should be considerably easier to maintain in the
long run, but may have some rough spots for now. Please forgive any gaudy
colors or styling. 

If you have feedback or just want to chat, feel free to contact me via the
links at the bottom of the page!
