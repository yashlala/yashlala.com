Hello! I'm Yash. 

I received a B.S. in Computer Science from UCLA in Spring 2022, and started
my Ph.D. at Yale in Fall 2023, under the advisorship of 
[Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/). 
I'm broadly interested in systems for
efficient data-center scale computing, although my recent work focuses on
[disaggregated memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02223.pdf) systems. 

If you'd like to chat, you can reach out to me at
<a href="mailto:yash.lala@yale.edu">yash.lala@yale.edu</a>, 
or via the links at the top of the page.
