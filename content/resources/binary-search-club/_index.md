A collection of materials from my presentations to the Binary Search Club
(BSC) during my undergrad. These materials were primarily for internal club use.

The BSC was an informal seminar of UCLA undergraduates. 
Every few weeks, one member presented on a topic of their choice -- ranging
from origami mathematics to film analysis. 

My own presentations tended to focus on computer history, my thoughts on
network abstractions, and computer systems + architecture. 
I eventually pursued the latter two topics during my PhD. 

The BSC started as a LeetCode practice group, until we realized that none of us
particularly enjoyed interview prep as a group activity ;). 

We then recreated the group into its present form, with two goals: 

1. To create an environment where students with varied interests can share
   their knowledge and discuss "what they've been reading this month". 
2. To improve our presentational skills.
