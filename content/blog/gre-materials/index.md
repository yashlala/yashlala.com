Back when I was applying for grad school, I found a great
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck for the GRE Vocabulary section online. 
It's quite complete, and includes memorable pictures for tricky words. 

Most of the deck is copied from online. I just made some fixes, replaced some
pictures, and added new words as I encountered them on practice tests. 

You can download the deck [here](gre-vocab-anki.apkg).
Maybe you'll find it useful.
