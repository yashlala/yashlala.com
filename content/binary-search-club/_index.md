A collection of materials from my presentations to the Binary Search Club (BSC)
during my undergrad. These materials were primarily for internal club use. 

The BSC was an informal seminar of UCLA undergraduates. Every week, one student
would present on a topic of their choice -- ranging from origami mathematics to
film analysis. I co-founded the BSC with two goals: 

1. To create an environment where students with varied interests can share
   their knowledge and discuss "what they've been reading this month". 
2. To improve our presentational skills.
