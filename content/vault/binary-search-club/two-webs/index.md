In this presentation, I talk about a shift in the nature of the World Wide
Web's content delivery systems -- a shift from "automatically downloading
documents via standard formats" to "portably running applications". 

Among other things, I explain: 

- How technical issues started this shift. 
- How economic issues accelerated this shift, often to the detriment of the
  user experience. Eg: web advertising provides disincentives against
  robust protocols for web accessibility. 
- The US legal system's perspective -- ft. the legality of AdBlock.
