My first non-technical and non-historical topic! Today is meant as a change of
pace before we go on hiatus for the quarter; it's information-light and full of
pretty pictures of ocean life. 

In this presentation, I talk about: 

1. Oceanbed life in the past. 
   - Why the Miller-Urey experiment is oversimplified. 
   - Three requirements for recurring lifelike chemical reactions, and why
     undersea vents uniquely provide all three. 
2. Oceanbed life today. 
   - A runthrough of the ecosystem. 
   - Why deep sea life is large and scary: Kleiber's rule, Bergman's rule, etc. 
3. Future oceanbed life
   - How stable are these ecosystems under global-warming related changes? 
   - The impact of undersea mining.
