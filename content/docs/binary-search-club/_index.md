A collection of materials from my presentations to the Binary Search Club
(BSC). These materials are primarily for internal club use.

The BSC ~~was~~ _is_ an informal seminar of UCLA ~~undergraduates~~ _alumni_. Every
few weeks, one member presents on a topic of their choice -- ranging from
origami mathematics to film analysis. 

The BSC started as a LeetCode club, until we realized that none of us
particularly enjoyed grinding LeetCode. 

We then recreated the group into its
present form, with two broad goals: 

1. To create an environment where students with varied interests can share
   their knowledge and discuss "what they've been reading this month". 
2. To improve our presentational skills.
