This presentation is an intermediate-level guide to Git. It also serves as a
primer to good version control conventions. If you've found yourself wondering
why you have spurious "merged branch X into X" commits after a `git pull`, this
presentation is for you. 

Git's CLI UI is phenomenally unintuitive (eg: `git tag` vs `git remote -v` vs
`git branch -a`). Git's default configuration is almost as bad. 

**Don't worry!** 

This presentation tries to build intuitions in a way that separates the
_beautiful idea_ from the _inconsistent implementation_. 
Once we see behind the smoke and mirrors, we'll be able to set up git aliases
that make more sense to us. You'll never have to remember the difference
between `--staged` and `--cached` again.
