Hello!

A few days ago, I was called on to write a brief essay. 

As with many theoretically-bilingual kids my age, I sometimes worry about
forgetting my 'mother tongue'. When I was younger, I felt most comfortable
speaking Hindi — but as my exposure to the English-speaking world grew, my
prior language skills began to atrophy. Given that my current version of
Hindi™ resembles Hindi about as much as a pile of wood chips resembles
a tree, I've now settled for speaking a mix of both languages. 

Now, this anecdote shouldn't have anything to do with my essay, which was in
plain English. But as it turns out, my Americanese isn't what it used to be,
either. 

# On the Deterioration of Data

As an engineering student, most of my courses focus on, well, engineering. The
only real writing I have to do nowadays is either technical writing (which is
its own flavor of text, and isn't very relevant to other fields) or texting
(which is also not super generalizable). 

The end result is that I'm no longer sure how to write. I'm very conscious of
it, even as I write now. Am I being too formal? Do I sound pretentious? Should
my writing style mimic my speaking style? I'm not quite sure. 

It's scary to realize that we can 'lose' such essential skills so easily.
(whatever happened to that adage about riding a bicycle?). But when I took
a good look at myself, I started to realize that the effect wasn't limited to
just my language abilities — most skills that I took for granted were being
eroded away by time. 

- When I was in middle school, I "wrote like a high schooler". Today, I still
  write like a high schooler, which is not great now that I'm in college. Why?
  I used to read and write probably more than I talked; I later shifted my
  "diet" to the literary equivalent of junk food. Garbage in -> Garbage out. 
- I spent most of my freshman year of college intensely exercising. After an
  elbow injury, I became complacent. My brief recovery break became
  a months-long hiatus from not just weight training and climbing but all forms
  of exercise. When I look at myself in the mirror today, I realize I've lost
  most of the immense progress I made; I've once again become a tumbleweed on
  a stick. 

Don't worry, this post isn't about to turn into a self-pity party ;). I've made
immense progress in so many aspects of my life in the past few years. I'm just
becoming very aware that unless I stay vigilant, *any* progress I make can be
easily undone. 

It's for this reason that I started to [refresh][dram] my old skillsets.

After a heavy dose of old Bollywood music, I've managed to halt the skill decay
for now; that said, I'm not sure I'll be able to regain my former abilities.
Our brains become increasingly less plastic with age. While there's evidence
that this decline [starts later than we initially thought][age], *re*learning
a language as an adult generally still takes longer than learning it as
a child. Similar trends hold true for my other areas of decay. I'm not as
adaptable as I used to be. That said, 99% is still much better than 0%
— dwelling on potential doesn't tend to get you anywhere in life. As such, I'm
making similar efforts in all my other areas of decay. I'm spending my
quarantine working myself back up to my previous strength, I'm starting to
reread my old notes, and — as you have probably guessed — I'm practicing
English by writing this blog entry. 

Of course, there are other ways to practice English. My creating a site has
a few associated benefits: 

- It feels good to produce content instead of consuming it. 
- Writing about my experiences will force me to reanalyze them. Explaining
  experiences usually helps you understand them better. 
- Logging my progress will give me a sense as to when I'm not making enough of
  it. 

Even now, I'm writing this in stealth to avoid waking up my family. (I'm typing
very quietly, so you may have to turn up your brightness). My hope is that
writing this blog, no matter what form it ends up evolving into, will continue
to have this same effect on me; I want it to be something worth staying up for. 

# A Purview Preview

If I added a user-counting mechanism to this site, this section would be
titled 'A Per-View Purview Preview'. Sadly, I'm not going to do that. 

What will this website's content mainly consist of?

- **Subject Recaps**: As discussed above, I'm starting to forget things. As
  I move through the next few months, I plan on forcibly "refreshing" these
  memories (which is a fancy way of saying "studying"). As I relearn some
  topics, I'll try and post my intuitions about how particular subjects work.
- **Thoughts**: My current method of oversharing my thoughts involves texting,
  calling, and group dinners. Using this site, I can harass multiple friends
  with one convenient link.
- **Tech Support**: When things don't work right and program documentation
  isn't helping, I usually end up Googling random keywords related to my issue.
  Usually, I'll find a blog post talking about the exact issue I'm trying to
  fix. These posts have saved me countless hours of pain — I'll be logging my
  own bug fixes and workarounds in an effort to try and repay that debt. 
- **School Notes**: I'm a student at UCLA, and take notes in most of my
  classes. I put a lot of time into formatting them, so I might as well put
  them up here for posterity. 
- **Other**: The great catch-all. I expect this topic to predominate over the
  others. 

# A Climactic Conclusion

It's late at night, and I'm running out of steam. Here.
